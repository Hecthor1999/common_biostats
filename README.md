# common_biostats
 This is a repository for the compilation of basic and complex biostatistics exercises which include the datasets, as well as comprehensive answers and plots.

# How to get started
Download the folders to your local machine, run the Rmd file in R and an html document with all the questions, code snippets and plots will appear.
The plots folder contains all of the images of all the plots included in the rmd file
The explanatory images folder contains images which allow for a better visualization of the question being asked
The further info folder contains pdf files with deep explanations of all the exercises which were made possible thanks to the help and collaboration of all the students of the Bioinformatics Master at the University of Bern 2023-2025.
